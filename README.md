# Will-Customer-Churn?e
**NOTE - Please see the Jupyter notebook(.ipynb file) for complete explanation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Project goals -
1. Data cleansing and preprocessing.
2. Data visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Statistical analysis of the data.
4. Model generation for prediction of customer churn behavior.
5. Application of Logistic Regression, SVM-Linear, SVM-RBF and Random Forest algorithms on data and performance comparison.

Project Description -
******************************************
Data source - Kaggle & IBM sample dataset community.
Dataset - Prediction of user behavior to retain customers. The dependent variable have binary value, 1 - churned and 0 - not or true/false. The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

To execute - python churn_rate.py

*Data was in a Csv file format. For other formats use other read function of pandas.
*Update the file path to local directory before running the file.
